# ADR-005: Observability and Monitoring Strategy

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The application lacks observability features essential for production deployment, including structured logging, health monitoring, metrics collection, and distributed tracing capabilities.

## Decision
Implement comprehensive observability to ensure production reliability and troubleshooting capabilities.

## Consequences

### Logging Strategy:
- Structured logging with Serilog (JSON format)
- Centralized log aggregation (ELK Stack, Azure Monitor, or similar)
- Log levels appropriate for production (avoid Debug logs)
- Correlation IDs for request tracing

### Health Checks:
- `/health` endpoint for container orchestration
- `/health/ready` for readiness probes
- `/health/live` for liveness probes
- Dependency health checks (database, external APIs)

### Metrics Collection:
- Application metrics (request count, response times, error rates)
- Business metrics (calculation requests, fee totals)
- Infrastructure metrics (CPU, memory, disk usage)
- Custom dashboards for monitoring

### Distributed Tracing:
- OpenTelemetry integration
- Request correlation across services
- Performance bottleneck identification

## Implementation TODO:
- [ ] Add Serilog with structured logging
- [ ] Implement health check endpoints
- [ ] Configure application metrics collection
- [ ] Set up distributed tracing
- [ ] Create monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Define alerting rules for critical metrics
