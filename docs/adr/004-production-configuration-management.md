# ADR-004: Production Configuration and Environment Management

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The application currently uses basic configuration suitable for development but lacks production-ready configuration management for secrets, environment-specific settings, and security configurations.

## Decision
Implement a comprehensive configuration strategy for production deployment.

## Consequences

### Configuration Files Needed:
- `appsettings.Production.json` with production-specific settings
- Environment-specific CORS policies
- Structured logging configuration
- Rate limiting and security headers

### Secrets Management:
- Use Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Kubernetes secrets
- Avoid hardcoded secrets in configuration files
- Implement configuration validation at startup

### Environment Variables:
- Database connection strings
- API endpoints and service discovery
- SSL certificate paths
- Feature flags

## Implementation TODO:
- [ ] Create appsettings.Production.json
- [ ] Configure environment-specific CORS policies  
- [ ] Implement secrets management strategy
- [ ] Add configuration validation
- [ ] Document deployment environment requirements
